 * exists to prevent (a public/open-registration IdP can assert
 * email_verified for an address it never confirmed ownership of just as
 * cheaply as a stranger typing it into a password signup). It also runs
 * before better-auth's own linking gate, so a grant here would persist even
 * if the sign-in then fails to link. Promotion for an SSO-linked ADMIN_EMAILS
